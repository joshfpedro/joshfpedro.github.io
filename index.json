However, I was rather intrigued by the mysteries surrounding math and although I had no idea what most of the symbols were, I enjoyed playing around with my calculator.\nI first came across the idea that 0.999\u0026hellip; = 1 (where the 9\u0026rsquo;s are repeating infinitely many times, of course) whilst studying Geometric Series and I must say, even after seeing the proof, I was not yet fully convinced. This was due to my lack of understanding of what \u0026ldquo;infinitely many\u0026rdquo; really meant. At the time, I needed something tangible that I could grasp.\nAn Informal Proof The basic intuition I had was to use the fact that 1 is a rational number and so is 0.999\u0026hellip;, since they are equal, then I must be able to express 0.999\u0026hellip; as a ratio of two integers which are equal to 1. This is very easy since the ratio of any integer, except 0, with itself is equal to 1. That is,\n$${a \\over a} = 1, a \\ne 0, a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$.\nNow, after spending some time playing around with the numbers on my calculator, I discovered the following pattern:\n$$\\frac{1}{9} = 0.111 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{2}{9} = \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{4}{9} = 0.444 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{5}{9} = 0.555 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3} = 0.666 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{7}{9} = 0.777 \\ldots$$\n$$\\frac{8}{9} = 0.888 \\ldots$$\nHere it was reasonable to assume by induction that, $$\\frac{9}{9} = 1 = 0.999\\ldots$$\nRigorous Proof First, we rewrite 0.999\u0026hellip; as the sequence of partial sums denoted by $$s_n$$ where n is the number of terms (or number of 9\u0026rsquo;s) and is given by:\n$$s_n = {9 \\over 10} + {9 \\over 10^2} + {9 \\over 10^3} + \\cdots + {9 \\over 10^n}$$\nMultiplying both sides by ${1 \\over 10}$ gives\n$${1 \\over 10} s_n = {9 \\over 10^2} + {9 \\over 10^3} + {9 \\over 10^4} + \\cdots + {9 \\over 10^{n+1}}$$\nSubtracting $(2)$ from $(1)$ then gives\n$$(1 - {1 \\over 10}) s_n = ({9 \\over 10} + {9 \\over 10^2} + {9 \\over 10^3} + \\cdots + {9 \\over 10^n}) - ({9 \\over 10^2} + {9 \\over 10^3} + {9 \\over 10^4} + \\cdots + {9 \\over 10^{n+1}})$$\nso\n$$(1 - {1 \\over 10}) s_n = {9 \\over 10} - {9 \\over 10^{n+1}}$$.\nTherefore,\n$$s_n = \\frac { \\frac {9}{10} - \\frac {9}{10^{n+1}}}{1 - \\frac {1}{10}} = 1 - {1 \\over 10^n}$$.\nHence,\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } {s_n} = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } {1 - {1 \\over 10^n}} = 1$$.\nThus, we conclude that 1 and 0.999\u0026hellip; are different decimal representations of the same real number.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1395ef195b6c5ea90d6d1fa8e8778d00","permalink":"https://joshfpedro.github.io/post/2017-11-18-first-post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-18-first-post/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction As a high school student, mathematics was the subject I struggled the most with.
